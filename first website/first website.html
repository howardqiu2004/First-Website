 <p>Hey, my name is Howard. I was born and raised in Vancouver and my parents are immigrants from China. I went to Lord Strathcona Elementary for half of kindergarten then moved to Queen Mary Elementary for the rest of my primary school education. After completing that, I moved on to Lord Byng Secondary and continued on to where I am today.</p>
 
 <p>During that time, I've completed bronze medallion, bronze cross and am currently certified for standard first aid. I am looking forward to start the next course to complete all my prerequisites to become a lifeguard. To do that I'll need to finish Water Safety Instructor (WSI) and National Lifeguard (NL).</p>
